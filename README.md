# VFE Framework

A simple browser extension framework for creating extensions with typescript and react.

This is the continuation of [web-game-hacking-boilerplate](https://github.com/vanflux/web-game-hacking-boilerplate). It stills with hacking/modding intentions, but, anyway it could be used for anything.

# Usage

- TODO

# Current features

- Chrome extension build
- Page script (script executed directly on web page)
- React support
- Automatic extension reload

# Goals

- Cross-browser build
- Create some 'vfe.js' configuration file (Ex: for configuring internal webpack)
- API for request rewriting
- API for content <-> page communication
