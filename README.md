# VFE Framework

A simple browser extension framework for creating extensions with typescript and react.

This is the continuation of [web-game-hacking-boilerplate](https://github.com/vanflux/web-game-hacking-boilerplate). It stills with hacking/modding intentions, but, anyway it could be used for anything.

- API for content <-> page communication
